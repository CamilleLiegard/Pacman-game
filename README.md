# Pacman-game

This game was build mostly following the tutorial of Ania Kubów: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CeUGlSl2i4Q&t=683s.

Recreating the famous 90’s video game was a great way to discover new facilities and features of Javascript, such as :

push() -> pushing elements to the end of an array.

switch() -> comparaison of various element in order to execute the code.

addEventListener() -> creating interactions with the user and the product.

document.createElement() -> create element from Javascript that will directly appear on the HTML file.

classList.add() -> create division inside the HTML elements.

appendChild() -> Connect Parents and Child elements inside the code.

if() -> executing a determined function if one statement is true.

ForEach() -> executing a determined function once for each element.
 

The game is functional on any desktop, you can start playing by simply clicking on the button start, and the game will go on until you lose or win.

It is a good exercise to get familiar with the creation of element (here, creation of the grid through Javascript), creating movements and directions, as well as different effects depending on different events; for exemple here the dot dissapear everytime pacman walks throught, but he also can't go throught the walls and there is a change with the ghosts everytime one of the green dot is eaten etc.


This development is available only for desktop.
